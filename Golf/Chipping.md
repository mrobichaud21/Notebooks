# 1. SOLID CONTACT
- We need solid contact to understand distance control.
- For ball-first contact on greenside shots, set up with your spine vertical and over the ball and shift your weight and the club’s handle slightly forward
  - DO NOT DROP YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER (MALASKA - [Chipping with Nicklaus, Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_11aiNK_wyw&list=PLX3gKbtyIhEaS-dkbE95ZvmppT3PvHazx&index=9))
- On greenside shots, your swing path will affect contact. Don’t take the club too far inside or to the outside
- Around the green, feel the sole of the club gliding off the grass; no digging
  - Setup; weight on forward leg, but spine vertical (shoulder level, don’t hang back with the right shoulder lower)
 - Low point control by setup.

## Drills for solid contact

### Swing Path

- Stick two alignment rods in the ground a foot apart and directly behind you, like field goal uprights
- Swing the club straight back between the rods for proper swing path
- If you go too far inside or outside, you’ll hit a rods and know your path is off

### Face Rotation

- Put on a golf glove
- When you take the club back a few feet, if the logo of your glove is pointed down, your clubface is too closed, and the club will tend to dig at impact
- To avoid this, let the clubface open going back so the logo is pointed up. This will allow the club’s bounce to glide along the turf at impact

# 2. Controlling Trajectory
- To hit low greenside shots, play the ball back; to hit medium-height shots, play it in the middle; to hit high shots, play it forward
  - Don’t change the handle location.
- To hit low greenside shots, don’t let the clubhead pass your hands much after impact; to hit it slightly higher, let the clubhead release past your hands a bit farther; to hit high shots, release the club head well past your hands
- Keep your energy and weight forward; don’t try to help the ball up

## Drills for Contolling Trajectory

### Use your belt line

- For low shots, play the ball back and as you swing to the finish, make sure the club’s butt end points above your belt line
- For medium-height shots, play the ball in the middle, and as you swing to the finish, make sure the club’s butt end points below your belt line
- For high shots, play the ball forward and as you swing to the finish, make sure the club’s butt end points down to the ground

# 3. Developing Touch
- To gauge distance on greenside shots, match your backswing length to your follow-through length
- For a good rhythm on pitch shots, feel a slight pause at the top of the swing
- To hit high pitches, you need an open clubface: Feel like the clubface is looking back at you on the backswing and back at you again at the finish
- Keep your grip light on greenside shots: On a 1-10 scale, no more than a 5

## Drills for Touch

### SYMMETRY
Use your body segments as check points
- Practice swinging back to knee high and through to knee high
- Then practice hip high to hip high
- Then shoulder to shoulder
- Make sure you’re swinging with a consistent rhythm each time 
  - count 1, 2, 3
  - 1, 2 on backswing
  - 3 on hit

### SCALES

- Set up three different landing spots with targets
- Place the first target a few feet onto the green and each successive target a few paces farther on
- Start by trying to hit the close one, then middle, then far. Then reverse the order
- Repeat the entire process three times

### CHIPPING MADE EASY

- Using a 9-iron or PW, set up close to the ball so the club’s heel is off the ground
- Feel like the handle is high
- Practice hitting chips from this setup
- Consider making this simple technique your go-to shot

# 4. Applying on the Course

- What type of lie do you have
  - On a deep greenside lie, steepen your angle of attack. If your ball is sitting up, your angle of attack should be shallower
- When you need a steep greenside swing—buried or downhill lie or ball below your feet lie—widen your stance, shift your weight left and lean the shaft forward
- When you need a shallow greenside swing—perched or uphill lie or ball above your feet—set up tall and make a wider swing with less wrist hinge
- For short-game success, consider how the ball will come out of the lie and what it will do when it lands and rolls

### DECISION-MAKING

- When practicing, hit from different lies
- Move to different spots around the green and different hole locations
- Practice your decision-making, not just your technique
